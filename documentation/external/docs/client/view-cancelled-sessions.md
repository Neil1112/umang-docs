# View Cancelled Session

---

This guide shows the process of viewing your cancelled sessions that you had booked as _Client_ on the Umang Wellness platform.

*Note** - As a _Client_, you cannot cancel a session once booked. The session can be cancelled only by the _Counsellor_ if he/she has some other concern at that time.

## Steps

1. Initial Location - [Client Dashboard](https://www.umangwellness.com/client/dashboard)

2. Look for section named **Cancelled Sessions**.

3. Click on the section to expand/collapse it.

4. You should see a list of your cancelled sessions inside it.

5. Click on any session to expand its details.

Once you go through these steps, you should be able to view your list of cancelled sessions on the Umang Wellness platform.
