This guide shows the process of signing up a _Client_ account. On Umang Wellness platform, a user is allowed to have multiple roles from _Client_ and _Counsellor_. A user can have either one or both of the roles.

If you are already registered as _Client_, then follow the steps in _[Sign In](./client-sign-in.md)_ guide to sign-in in your _Client Dashboard_.
